### Day 3: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" section from #freeCodeCamp and I created a simple SignUp form to practice what I have learned from the above section.

Configured fake REST API in my local by using https://github.com/typicode/json-server and sent a POST request using that API endpoint.

Watched this video https://youtu.be/1zkgdLZEdwM to get a better understanding about JSON-server.


**Thoughts:** It is going well.
